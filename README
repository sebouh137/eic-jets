# For the example below, I assume you have already installed delphes in ../delphes_install

# To create the initial root file (you may want to increase the number of events in the pythia card file):
../delphes_install/bin/DelphesPythia8 tcl/delphes_card_allsilicon_3T.tcl pythia8cards/CC_DIS.cmnd out_10k.root

# Then convert this to a tuple format (much easier to process with pandas)
python python/eicroot2pandas.py out_10k.root test.root 10000 -h

# Then you can open the created tuple file in a notebook.
